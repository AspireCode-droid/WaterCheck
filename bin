Design a clean, modern "Services" webpage section for a water treatment company. Use a responsive grid layout with six visually consistent service cards. Each card should have:

A soft white background, subtle shadow, rounded corners (xl radius), and hover effect that slightly lifts the card with a deeper shadow.

An icon in a circular container with a soft blue background (#0077be1a) and icon color #0077be.

Title: bold, large (text-xl), centered or left-aligned.

Description: small, muted grey (text-gray-700), concise.

CTA link styled in #0077be, medium weight, with hover underline.
